# Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis

Machine learning researchers often evaluate their predictions directly on the whole test set.
But, in fact, in real-world settings we have additional choices available, like asking for more information when we are uncertain.
Because of the importance of accurate diagnosis, it would be unreasonable _not_ to ask for further scans of the most ambiguous cases.
Moreover, in this dataset, many images feature camera artefacts that distort results.
In these cases, it is critically important that a model is able to tell when the information provided to it is not sufficiently reliable to classify the patient.
Just like real medical professionals, any diagnostic algorithm should be able to flag cases that require more investigation by medical experts.

This task is illustrated in the figure above, where a threshold, `τ`, is used to flag cases as certain and uncertain, with uncertain cases referred to an expert. Alternatively, the uncertainty estimates could be used to come up with a priority list, which could be matched to the available resources of a hospital, rather than waste diagnostic resources on patients for whom the diagnosis is clear cut.

In order to simulate this process of referring the uncertain cases to experts and relying on the model's predictions for cases it is certain of, we assess the techniques by their diagnostic accuracy and area under receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve, as a function of the
referral rate. We expect the models with well-calibrated uncertainty to refer their least confident predictions to experts,
improving their performance as the number of referrals increases.

The accuracy of the binary classifier is defined as the ratio of correctly classified data-points over the size of the population.
The receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve illustrates
the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.
It is created by plotting the true positive rate (a.k.a. sensitivity) against the false positive rate (a.k.a. 1 - sensitivity).
The quality of such a ROC curve can be summarized by its area under the curve (AUC), which varies between 0.5 (chance level) and 1.0 (best possible value).

To get a better insight into the mechanics of these plots, below we show the relation between predictive uncertainty, e.g. entropy `H_{pred}` of MC Dropout (on y-axis), and maximum-likelihood, i.e. sigmoid probabilities `p(disease| image)` of a deterministic dropout model (on x-axis). In red are images classified incorrectly, and in green are images classified correctly. You can see that the model has higher *uncertainty* for the miss-classified images, whereas the softmax probabilities cannot distinguish red from green for low p (i.e. the plot is separable along the y-axis, but not the x-axis). Hence the uncertainty can be used as an indicator to drive referral.

## Download and Prepare

The raw data is licensed and hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection),
hence you will need a Kaggle account to fetch it. The Kaggle Credentials can be found at

```
https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account -> "Create New API Key"
```

After creating an API key you will need to accept the dataset license.
Go to [the dateset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/overview) and look
for the button `I Understand and Accept` (make sure when reloading the page that the button does not pop up again).

The [Kaggle command line interface](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) is used for downloading the data, which
assumes that the API token is stored at `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`. Run the following commands to populate it:

```
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
echo '{"username":"${KAGGLE_USERNAME}","key":"${KAGGLE_KEY}"}' > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

Download and prepare the data by running:

```
python3 -u -c "from bdlb.diabetic_retinopathy_diagnosis.benchmark import DiabeticRetinopathyDiagnosisBecnhmark; DiabeticRetinopathyDiagnosisBecnhmark.download_and_prepare()"
```

## Run a Baseline

  --level=medium \
  --dropout_rate=0.2 \
  --output_dir=tmp/medium.mc_dropout
```

Or alternatively, use the `baselines/*/configs` for tuned hyperparameters per baseline:

```
python3 baselines/diabetic_retinopathy_diagnosis/mc_dropout/main.py --flagfile=baselines/diabetic_retinopathy_diagnosis/mc_dropout/configs/medium.cfg
```
